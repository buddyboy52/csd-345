        <p>

            When I was a sophomore in highschool, I fell in <span id="love">____</span> with a girl who I did not know would be my future wife. She was the most beautiful girl that I had ever laid eyes on and I could not believe how lucky I was.

        </p>

        <p>

            We started out as bestfriends who just got out of toxic relationships. We were not looking for a rebound, but instead were looking for a friend. We hung out every day in the Summer of 2015. We would go to the <span id="pool">____</span> together where we would split our change to see what snacks we could buy.

        </p>

        <p>

            You see, life was simple back then. We did not have any bills or responsibilities. It was just me and this girl against the <span id="world">_____</span>. If someone had told me that this girl and I would be together for the rest of our lives, I would have just laughed. This girl meant the world to me but I thought that this was just a highschool relationship that would end when we went off to college. Little did I know, I was wrong.

        </p>

        <p>

            This girl, who I now call my wife, is the highlight of my day. She makes me a better person and I would not change her for the world. We are expecting a baby <span id="boy">_______________________</span>  and I hope he gets to see just how special his mom is. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for my family and I but I know that no matter what, it will be great.

        </p>
